protomson
---------

This is a dumb, bad, awful protobuf plugin for generating MSON, a dumb,
bad, awful format, from protobuf files so it can be copied into API
blueprint files and other stuff. This is intended for use with Apiary,
in particular, but may result in valid MSON that Apiary is incapable of
parsing due to issues (at the time of this writing) in their API
blueprint parser. You've been warned.

        go get go.spiff.io/protomson/cmd/protoc-gen-mson

You shouldn't use this, but you also shouldn't use MSON in general.
Those involved in its creation are truly warped.


Installation
------------

Run the `go get` command above.


Usage
-----

protomson is used the same as any other protoc plugin when specifying
the output format:

        protoc --mson_out=. *.proto

This will output files with the suffix .pb.mson. The resulting files'
contents may be used as data structures in a full API blueprint format.

The plugin is written with the expectation that users are targetting
syntax="proto3". So, for example, given the following proto3 message:

        // Chunk is used to pass a raw set of bytes and identifying name
        // to a remote API.
        message Chunk {
                // name contains a simple name identifying the Chunk.
                string name = 1;
                Type type = 2; // type is the type of the blob.
                // blob is the raw bytes held by the Chunk.
                bytes blob = 3;

                enum Type {
                        DATA     = 0;
                        CHECKSUM = 1;
                        SPIDER   = 2;
                }
        }

protomson will output the following MSON:

        ## Chunk (object)
        Chunk is used to pass a raw set of bytes and identifying name
        to a remote API.

        ### Properties
        + name (string, optional) -
            name contains a simple name identifying the Chunk.
        + type (Chunk.Type, optional) -
            type is the type of the blob.
        + blob (string, optional) -
            blob is the raw bytes held by the Chunk.

        ## Chunk.Type (enum)
        # Members
        + `DATA`
        + `CHECKSUM`
        + `SPIDER`


Optionally, if a message's trailing comment contains only the word
"private" (ignoring whitespace), that message will be excluded from
output.  This is finnicky and will likely be removed.
